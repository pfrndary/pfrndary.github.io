Sure, here are the simple steps to install ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) stack on a Linux system:

1. Install Elasticsearch:
	* Download the appropriate package for your distribution from <https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch>
	* Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice (e.g., /usr/local)
	* Configure and start Elasticsearch by running the following commands:
```bash
sudo mv elasticsearch /usr/local/elasticsearch-{version}
cd /usr/local/elasticsearch-{version}
sudo ./bin/elasticsearch -s {master_url}
```
Replace `{version}` with your actual version number, and `{master_url}` with the URL of the Elastic Cloud (EC2) instance hosting Logstash.
2. Install Logstash:
	* Download the appropriate package for your distribution from <https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash>
	* Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice (e.g., /usr/local)
	* Configure and start Logstash by running the following commands:
```bash
sudo mv logstash /usr/local/logstash-{version}
cd /usr/local/logstash-{version}
sudo ./bin/logstash -f {config_file}
```
Replace `{version}` with your actual version number, and `{config_file}` with the path to a configuration file that tells Logstash where to forward data (e.g., log files or network streams).
3. Install Kibana:
	* Download the appropriate package for your distribution from <https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana>
	* Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice (e.g., /usr/local/kibana)
	* Configure and start Kibana by running the following commands:
```bash
sudo mv kibana /usr/local/kibana-{version}
cd /usr/local/kibana-{version}
sudo ./bin/kibana
```
Replace `{version}` with your actual version number.
4. (Optional) Set up monitoring and logging:
	* Configure Elasticsearch to send data to Logstash by modifying the Elasticsearch configuration file (/usr/local/elasticsearch-{version}/config/elasticsearch.yml). Add a logstash input block that tells Elasticsearch where to forward data. For example:
```yaml
logstash:
  hosts: ["http://localhost:810"] # Replace with the URL of your Logstash instance running on another machine or container
```
* Configure Logstash to send data to Kibana by modifying the Logstash configuration file (/usr/local/logstash-{version}/config/logstash.yml). Add a kibana output block that tells Logstash where to forward data:
```yaml
output {
  # Use HTTP as the transport protocol
  http {
    host "localhost"
    port 5601
    format "json"
  }
}
```
Replace `http://localhost:810` with the URL of your Kibana instance running on another machine or container.
* Set up monitoring and logging for your Linux system by following relevant guides, such as <https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/s2-managing-logfiles.html> or similar documentation for your specific Linux distribution and logging tools (e.g., syslog, logrotate).

By following these steps, you should have a basic ELK stack installation on your Linux system. Remember to adjust the configuration files according to your use case and environment.
